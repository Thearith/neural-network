#Machine Learnging with Neural Network

A step detection classifier using neural network (with back propagation algorithm) to determine whether a peak in accelerometer data is either a heel strike or a non heel strike. Written in python.

**Library:** 
* pybrain, [Nesta CMS](http://pybrain.org/)

**How to run the program:** 
* Input your training data (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass) in training folder
* Change the file names in neural_network.py
* ***To run the program***: python neural_network.py
