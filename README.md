#Machine Learnging with Neural Network

A step detection classifier using neural network (with back propagation algorithm) to determine whether a peak in accelerometer data is either a heel strike or a non heel strike. Written in python.

**Library:** 
* [pybrain](http://pybrain.org/)

**How to run the program:** 
* Input your training data (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass) in folder *training*
* Change the file names in *neural_network.py*
* ***To run the program***: *python neural_network.py*
