#Machine Learnging with Neural Network

A step detection classifier using neural network (with back propagation algorithm) to determine whether a peak in accelerometer data is either a heel strike or a non heel strike

**Library:** * pybrain

**How to run the program:** * Input your training data (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass) in training folder
* Change the file names in neural_network.py
* To run the program: python neural_network.py
